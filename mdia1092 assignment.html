If you’ve lived in Australia for a couple of years, then you’ve probably become <br>familiar with the Australian Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Whether by your own free will and the internet, various governmental ad campaigns,<br> or being legally mandated to fill out a census questionnaire, you’ve come across it. 
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Now what?

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Say you want to find out the results, the data the Census has come out with about the <br>state of the country. What’s changed since the previous census was held 5 years ago? <br> <br>
A quick Google search will lead you to the ABS website, where you’re swiftly bombarded<br> with walls of text and numbers.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

You return to the search tab, scrolling down some more and come across the ABC’s <br>article “Census 2021 — Australia as 100 people”. A conveniently easily digestible<br> re-rendering of census data which delivers the results to you in bite-size chunks.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

They simplified the census by representing the population of Australia “as 100 people”. <br>The corporation displayed this simplified data as a map of dots separated into categories where 
<br><br>
<div style="width: 50px; height: 50px; background-color: white; border-color:white; border-radius:250px;"></div>
<br>
1 dot = 1%
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

However, the ABC failed to include many marginalized groups, including an often <br>overlooked concern of the census, one that the ABS themselves took note <br>of and went out of their way to strategize including;

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The significance of the homeless population.
<br>
<div style="width: 150px; margin: 50px auto; text-align: center;">
<div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 75px solid transparent; border-right: 75px solid transparent; border-bottom: 75px solid #FFFFFF;"></div>
<div style="
width: 150px; 
height: 120px; 
background-color: #FFFFFF; 
border: 1px solid #000000;"></div>
</div>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Perhaps this exclusion is because this marginalized group, amongst others, cannot <br>be represented by 1 dot, thus showing a major flaw in the ABC’s visualization <br>strategy.They don’t make- up 1% of the population, but rather approximately  
<br><br>

<div style="width: 25px; height: 50px; background-color: white; border-color: white; border-radius: 25px 0 0 25px;"></div>
<br> 
half a dot = 0.5%

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

However, homelessness ought to be counted, the nuances of this issue must not remain invisible… <br>
So, let us look closer into this half dot statistic...

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<div style="position: relative; width: 1250px; height: 2500px; background-color: white; border-radius: 1250px 0 0 1250px; overflow: hidden;">

<div style="position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-20%, -50%); font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', serif; font-size: 1.5em; color: rgb(13, 101, 156); text-align: right;">
Of those experiencing homelessness in 2021:<br>
-> 55.9% were male, an increase of 1.6% from 2016<br>
-> 44.1% were female, an increase of 10.1% from 2016.<br>
<img src="half1.jpg" width="200px" alt="half dot colored 55.9% blue and 44.1% pink">
<br>
<br>
<br><br>
Young people have the highest rates of homelessness: <br>
-> Nearly a quarter (23.0%) of all people experiencing homelessness were aged from 12 to 24 years (in green)<br>
-> 14.4% (in yellow) were aged under 12 years <br>
<img src="half2.jpg" width="200px" alt="half dot colored 23% green and 14.4% yellow">
<br><br><br>
<br>
However, even these numbers are somewhat arbitrary, because when you really think about it...

what really defines homelessness?
